Comprehensive System Review ‚Äì PrintSphere POS
‚úÖ General Status:
The system is successfully running with main modules active.

Most of the UI components load correctly.

Core flows like creating orders, selecting services, and calculating totals are partially functioning.

üî¥ Outstanding Functional Issues & Gaps
1. ‚ùå Add Services ‚Äì Not Displaying in POS
Issue:
New services added from the Admin panel are not reflected in the POS view.

The cashier cannot access or select the newly created service.

Likely Cause:
The POS component does not fetch the latest service list after adding.

Once a new service is saved, it should immediately appear in the POS interface under Standard or Dynamic tabs.

Completed transactions do not have any printable invoice or receipt.

The cashier has no access to order summary after checkout.
