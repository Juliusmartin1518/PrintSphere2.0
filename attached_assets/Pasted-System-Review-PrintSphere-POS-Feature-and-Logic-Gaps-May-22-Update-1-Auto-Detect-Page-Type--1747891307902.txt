System Review: PrintSphere POS – Feature and Logic Gaps (May 22 Update)
1. 🔴 Auto-Detect Page Type – Document Printing
❌ Current Behavior:
When “Auto Detect” is selected in Color Mode, the system proceeds with generic pricing logic as if color was selected.

✅ Expected Behavior:
System should perform an actual page breakdown and return a summary like:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Total Pages: 4  
Colored: 3 pages × ₱2/page = ₱6  
Black & White: 1 page × ₱1/page = ₱1  
Total: ₱7
No fixed multiplier should be applied. Pricing should reflect the actual color classification results from the file.

2. ❌ Copies Field Auto-Populates with Page Count
Problem:
After uploading a file, the Number of Copies field is automatically filled with the page count (e.g., 4 pages → 4 copies), which is unintended.

Expected:
The Number of Copies field should remain untouched.

Page count should only appear in a read-only “Total Pages” display.

3. 🔁 CRUD Operations Missing for Services and Inventory
❌ Current Gaps:
You can add a new service/inventory item.

But you cannot edit, update, or delete entries from the dashboard.

Expected:
Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for:

Services: Adjust rates, names, and service types

Inventory: Update stock levels, item status, or remove obsolete items

4. 📊 Reports Tab – Visualization Not Functional
❌ Current Behavior:
The Reports tab uses sample data or static charts.

It does not reflect real-time orders, revenue, or inventory movements.

Expected:
Reports must use live data from the database to generate:

Daily/weekly/monthly sales

Most popular services

Inventory stock vs. usage

Expense vs. income analytics

5. 👤 Customer Tracking System – Missing
❌ Currently:
No way to store, search, or retrieve customer records.

Receipts do not include any customer data.

✅ Expected Features:
A. Customer Tab
Add new customers (Name, Address, Age, Contact Number)

View existing customers with order history

Edit or delete customer records

B. POS Customer Integration
Text fields at checkout for:

Name

Address

Age

Contact Number

Smart Auto-Suggest:

As the user types, system suggests matches from database

If a match is selected, auto-fills full details

If not found, system saves as a new customer

C. Receipt and Order Linking
Order should store and display:

Customer ID or info block

Tagged on receipt/invoice

Used for future loyalty, tracking, and reporting
