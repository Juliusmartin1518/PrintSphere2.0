 Functional & Technical Issues
1. ❌ Dynamic Document Price Computation Not Integrated
✅ What You Have:
A working standalone price calculator using logic like:

js
Copy
Edit
coloredPages * ₱5 + blackPages * ₱1 + pageCount * (paperType + quality) * copies
🔴 What’s Missing in the POS:
Auto-analysis of uploaded PDFs or DOCX files is not embedded in the POS interface.

Page count, color detection, and total computation do not run after upload.

UI elements for displaying page analysis and computed price are not linked.

📌 Sample script you shared is correct, but needs:
Integration inside the POS service component

Triggered on upload or “Analyze” button click

Display breakdown in the price section

2. ❌ Tarpaulin Upload Not Clickable
Upload area exists but is not interactive.

No response on click or drag.

File selection dialog does not open.

3. ❌ Add Services Not Visible in POS
Services created from the Admin panel do not appear in the POS service list.

Likely missing:

Dynamic refresh on POS page

API response update to include new entries

4. ❌ Checkout - No Receipt/Invoice Preview
On order completion, there is no post-payment receipt.

No option to print, preview, or export.

No reprint from order history or "Done" list.

5. ❌ Orders Tab – React Infinite Render Error
Error:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop.
This is caused by:

A useEffect or state change updating repeatedly without an exit condition

Possibly in the Orders or Receipt render logic

6. ❌ Missing Customer Registration and Tagging
Requested Feature:
A way to:

Register new customers

Select existing ones during checkout

Show their name/contact in the receipt

Expected Flow:
POS has a “Select/Add Customer” button

Auto-fill if existing customer is found

Store customerId in orders

Show in invoice like:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Customer: John Santos
Email: john@example.com
Phone: 09123456789

💡 Immediate Next Steps You Can Take
Integrate auto-analyze script into the POS dynamic pricing module.

Add customer select/register modal in POS.

Enable receipt print preview after payment.

Fix React loop in Orders.jsx or useEffect logic.

Adjust backend to return newly created services in API.
