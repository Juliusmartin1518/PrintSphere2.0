System Review Update – PrintSphere POS
Focus: Document Pricing, Customer Tracking, and Order Checkout

1. 🔴 Price Calculation – Document Printing (Auto Detect Mode)
❌ Current Behavior:
The pricing still includes a "Base Price" and uses generic multipliers.

The breakdown is not clearly separated into Colored Pages, Black & White Pages, and Paper Type.

Price summary is not user-friendly or transparent when auto detect is selected.

✅ Expected Behavior:
When "Auto Detect" is selected:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Paper Type: Glossy
Colored Pages: 4 × ₱2.00 = ₱8.00  
Black & White Pages: 6 × ₱1.00 = ₱6.00  
Copies: 2  
Total per Page: ₱14.00  
Total (x2 Copies): ₱28.00
No base price should be shown.

The pricing layout should dynamically adjust based on actual page analysis and user selection.

2. 🟡 Pricing Configuration – Admin Panel
✅ Expected Behavior:
Admin should have the ability to configure:

Price per Colored Page

Price per Black & White Page

Rate per Paper Type

Rate per Paper Size

The POS should reflect updated rates in real time during service selection and calculation.

3. 🔴 Customer Search/Add – Error on Checkout
❌ Current Behavior:
Customer search and new entry fields are available in POS.

On submission or during checkout with a new/existing customer, the system throws a 500 Internal Server Error.

📝 Observation:
Customer data is passed through the POS but causes a backend failure.

The error blocks order completion and prevents saving customer information.

4. ❌ Customer Tab Click – Does Not Load
❌ Current Behavior:
Clicking the Customer tab on the sidebar redirects to the dashboard or does nothing.

No customer management view or page is loaded.

📝 Observation:
The system lacks a functional view for listing customers or accessing customer records.

5. ❌ Customer Order History – Missing
❌ Current Behavior:
There is no way to view what a customer has ordered in the past.

POS and Admin areas do not show a linked history of customer transactions.

✅ Expected Behavior:
When viewing a customer profile, the system should display:

A list of all past orders

Order details including services, amounts, and statuses

🔧 Summary Table
Area	Status	Problem Description
Document Print Price Layering	❌ Broken	Base price shown; breakdown not layered or dynamic
Configurable Rates	❌ Missing	No interface to manage pricing (Color, B&W, Paper Type, Size)
Customer Add/Search	❌ Error 500	Causes backend error during checkout or new entry
Customer Tab	❌ Redirect	Clicking tab redirects to dashboard; no customer view exists
Customer Order History	❌ Missing	No ability to view or filter previous orders per customer

✅ Prioritized Action Plan
Update the Document Print UI and layer the price breakdown correctly.

Add a rate configuration interface for pricing variables (Color, B&W, Paper Type, Paper Size).

Enable seamless customer creation and search within the POS without backend failure.

Ensure the Customer tab loads a full management interface.

Display all previous orders when viewing an individual customer's record.
